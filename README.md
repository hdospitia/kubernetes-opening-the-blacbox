# Kubernetes. Opening The Black Box

Use the command files one by one to launch a Linux Namespaces Demo. The 00-... file is intented for a basic, point-to-point connection demo, while the 01-... allows to create a more complex connection between Linux Namespaces using a virtual bridge (OpenVSwitch).

Also, use the example manifests to launch Kind Kubernetes clusters with sample ClusterIP and NodePort Service Types.

The repo's purpose is to be used during the Opening The Black Box talk.
